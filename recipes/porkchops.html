        <p>With a few simple tricks, you can make juicy and tender pork chops with very little fuss.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Pork Chops</li>
            <li>All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>Chili Powder</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the pork chops out of the refrigerator and season on both sides with salt and pepper â€” we use just less than 1/4 teaspoon of fine salt per pork chop. Set the chops aside to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the spice rub. In a small bowl, mix the flour, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and smoked paprika. After 30 minutes, use a paper towel to pat the pork chops dry then rub both sides of the chops with the spice rub.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a medium skillet (with lid) over medium-high heat. As soon as the oil is hot and looks shimmery, add the pork. Cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the pork so that the seared side is facing up. (If there is a fattier side of the pork, use kitchen tongs to hold the chops, fat-side-down until it sizzles and browns slightly; about 30 seconds.) Reduce the heat to low then cover the skillet with a lid. Cook 6 to 12 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reads 145 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the chop. (Since cook time depends on the thickness of the chops, check for doneness at 5 minutes then go from there, checking every 2 minutes). If you do not have a thermometer, you will know they are done, if when cutting into the chops, the juices run clear.</li>
            <li>Transfer pork chops to a plate then cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let the pork rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
